**This code follows the implementation architecture of Detectron.** Only part of the functionality is supported. Check [this section](#supported-network-modules) for more information.

With this code, you can...

1. **Train your model from scratch.**
2. **Inference using the pretrained weight file (*.pkl) from Detectron.**

This repository is originally built on [jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch). However, after many modifications, the structure changes a lot and it's now more similar to [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron). I deliberately make everything similar or identical to Detectron's implementation, so as to reproduce the result directly from official pretrained weight files.

This implementation has the following features:

- **It is pure Pytorch code**. Of course, there are some CUDA code.

- **It supports multi-image batch training**.

- **It supports multiple GPUs training**.

- **It supports three pooling methods**. Notice that only **roi align** is revised to match the implementation in Caffe2. So, use it.

- **It is memory efficient**. For data batching, there are two techiniques available to reduce memory usage: 1) *Aspect grouping*: group images with similar aspect ratio in a batch 2) *Aspect cropping*: crop images that are too long. Aspect grouping is implemented in Detectron, so it's used for default. Aspect cropping is the idea from [jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), and it's not used for default.

  Besides of that, I implement a customized `nn.DataParallel ` module which enables different batch blob size on different gpus. Check [My nn.DataParallel](#my-nndataparallel) section for more details about this.

## News

- (2018/05/25) Support ResNeXt backbones.
- (2018/05/22) Add group normalization baselines.
- (2018/05/15) PyTorch0.4 is supported now !

## Getting Started
Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/roytseng-tw/mask-rcnn.pytorch.git
```

### Requirements

Tested under python3.

- python packages
  - pytorch>=0.3.1
  - torchvision>=0.2.0
  - cython
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - opencv
  - pyyaml
  - packaging
  - [pycocotools](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi)  — for COCO dataset, also available from pip.
  - tensorboardX  — for logging the losses in Tensorboard
- An NVIDAI GPU and CUDA 8.0 or higher. Some operations only have gpu implementation.
- **NOTICE**: different versions of Pytorch package have different memory usages.

### Compilation

Compile the CUDA code:

```
cd lib  # please change to this directory
sh make.sh
```

If your are using Volta GPUs, uncomment this [line](https://github.com/roytseng-tw/mask-rcnn.pytorch/tree/master/lib/make.sh#L15) in `lib/mask.sh` and remember to postpend a backslash at the line above. `CUDA_PATH` defaults to `/usr/loca/cuda`. If you want to use a CUDA library on different path, change this [line](https://github.com/roytseng-tw/mask-rcnn.pytorch/tree/master/lib/make.sh#L3) accordingly.

It will compile all the modules you need, including NMS, ROI_Pooing, ROI_Crop and ROI_Align. (Actually gpu nms is never used ...)

Note that, If you use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to set gpus, **make sure at least one gpu is visible when compile the code.**

### Data Preparation

Create a data folder under the repo,

```
cd {repo_root}
mkdir data
```

- **COCO**:
  Download the coco images and annotations from [coco website](http://cocodataset.org/#download).

  And make sure to put the files as the following structure:
  ```
  coco
  ├── annotations
  |   ├── instances_minival2014.json
  │   ├── instances_train2014.json
  │   ├── instances_train2017.json
  │   ├── instances_val2014.json
  │   ├── instances_val2017.json
  │   ├── instances_valminusminival2014.json
  │   ├── ...
  |
  └── images
      ├── train2014
      ├── train2017
      ├── val2014
      ├── val2017
      ├── ...
  ```
  Download coco mini annotations from [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/detectron/coco/coco_annotations_minival.tgz).
  Please note that minival is exactly equivalent to the recently defined 2017 val set. Similarly, the union of valminusminival and the 2014 train is exactly equivalent to the 2017 train set.

   Feel free to put the dataset at any place you want, and then soft link the dataset under the `data/` folder:

   ```
   ln -s path/to/coco data/coco
   ```
   
- **PASCAL VOC 2007 + 12**
  Please follow the instructions in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) to prepare VOC datasets. Actually, you can refer to any others. After downloading the data, creat softlinks in the `data/VOC<year>` folder as folows,
  ```
  VOCdevkitPATH=/path/to/voc_devkit
  mkdir -p $DETECTRON/detectron/datasets/data/VOC<year>
  ln -s /${VOCdevkitPATH}/VOC<year>/JPEGImages $DETECTRON.PYTORCH/data/VOC<year>/JPEGImages
  ln -s /${VOCdevkitPATH}/VOC<year>/json_annotations $DETECTRON.PYTORCH/data/VOC<year>/annotations
  ln -s /${VOCdevkitPATH} $DETECTRON.PYTORCH/data/VOC<year>/VOCdevkit<year>
  ```
  The directory structure of `JPEGImages` and `annotations` should be as follows,
  ```
  VOC<year>
  ├── annotations
  |   ├── train.json
  │   ├── trainval.json
  │   ├── test.json
  │   ├── ...
  |
  └── JPEGImages
      ├── <im-1-name>.jpg
      ├── ...
      ├── <im-N-name>.jpg
  ```
  **NOTE:** The `annotations` folder requires you to have PASCAL VOC annotations in COCO json format, which is available for download [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/coco-dataset/external/PASCAL_VOC.zip). You can also convert the XML annotatinos files to JSON by running the following script,
  ```
  python tools/pascal_voc_xml2coco_json_converter.py $VOCdevkitPATH $year
  ```
  (In order to succesfully run the script above, you need to update the full path to the respective folders in the script).
  
- **Custom Dataset**
  Similar to above, create a directory named `CustomDataset` in the `data` folder and add symlinks to the `annotations` directory and `JPEGImages` as shown for Pascal Voc dataset. You also need to link the custom dataset devkit to `CustomDataDevkit`.

Recommend to put the images on a SSD for possible better training performance

### Pretrained Model

I use ImageNet pretrained weights from Caffe for the backbone networks.

- [ResNet50](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wHSvusQ1CiEMc5Nx5R8adqoHQjIDWXl1), [ResNet101](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x2fTMqLrn63EMW0VuK4GEa2eQKzvJ_7l), [ResNet152](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NSCycOb7pU0KzluH326zmyMFUU55JslF)
- [VGG16](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19UphT53C0Ua9JAtICnw84PPTa3sZZ_9k)  (vgg backbone is not implemented yet)

Download them and put them into the `{repo_root}/data/pretrained_model`.

You can the following command to download them all:

- extra required packages: `argparse_color_formater`, `colorama`, `requests`

```
python tools/download_imagenet_weights.py
```

**NOTE**: Caffe pretrained weights have slightly better performance than Pytorch pretrained. Suggest to use Caffe pretrained models from the above link to reproduce the results. By the way, Detectron also use pretrained weights from Caffe.

**If you want to use pytorch pre-trained models, please remember to transpose images from BGR to RGB, and also use the same data preprocessing (minus mean and normalize) as used in Pytorch pretrained model.**

#### ImageNet Pretrained Model provided by Detectron

- [R-101-GN.pkl](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/detectron/ImageNetPretrained/47592356/R-101-GN.pkl)
- [X-101-32x8d.pkl](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/detectron/ImageNetPretrained/20171220/X-101-32x8d.pkl)
- [X-101-64x4d.pkl](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/detectron/ImageNetPretrained/FBResNeXt/X-101-64x4d.pkl)

Besides of using the pretrained weights for ResNet above, you can also use the weights from Detectron by changing the corresponding line in model config file as follows:
```
RESNETS:
  IMAGENET_PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS: 'data/pretrained_model/R-50.pkl'
```

R-50-GN.pkl and R-101-GN.pkl are required for gn_baselines.

X-101-32x8d.pkl, X-101-64x4d.pkl and X-152-32x8d-IN5k.pkl are required for ResNeXt backbones.

## Training

**DO NOT CHANGE anything in the provided config files(configs/\*\*/xxxx.yml) unless you know what you are doing**

Use the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to control which GPUs to use.

### Adapative config adjustment

#### Let's define some terms first

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; batch_size:            `NUM_GPUS` x `TRAIN.IMS_PER_BATCH`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effective_batch_size:  batch_size x `iter_size`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change of somethining: `new value of something / old value of something`

Following config options will be adjusted **automatically** according to actual training setups: 1) number of GPUs `NUM_GPUS`, 2) batch size per GPU `TRAIN.IMS_PER_BATCH`, 3) update period `iter_size`

- `SOLVER.BASE_LR`: adjust directly propotional to the change of batch_size.
- `SOLVER.STEPS`, `SOLVER.MAX_ITER`: adjust inversely propotional to the change of effective_batch_size.

### Train from scratch
Take mask-rcnn with res50 backbone for example.
```
python tools/train_net_step.py --dataset coco2017 --cfg configs/baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-50-C4.yml --use_tfboard --bs {batch_size} --nw {num_workers}
```

Use `--bs` to overwrite the default batch size to a proper value that fits into your GPUs. Simliar for `--nw`, number of data loader threads defaults to 4 in config.py.

Specify `—-use_tfboard` to log the losses on Tensorboard.

**NOTE**: 
  - use `--dataset keypoints_coco2017` when training for keypoint-rcnn.
  - use `--dataset voc2007` when training for PASCAL VOC 2007.
  - use `--dataset voc2012` when training for PASCAL VOC 2012.
  - use `--dataset custom_dataset --num_classes $NUM_CLASSES` when training for your custom dataset. Here, `$NUM_CLASSES` is the number of object classes **+ 1** (for background class) present in your custom dataset.

### The use of `--iter_size`
As in Caffe, update network once (`optimizer.step()`) every `iter_size` iterations (forward + backward). This way to have a larger effective batch size for training. Notice that, step count is only increased after network update.

```
python tools/train_net_step.py --dataset coco2017 --cfg configs/baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-50-C4.yml --bs 4 --iter_size 4
```
`iter_size` defaults to 1.

### Finetune from a pretrained checkpoint
```
python tools/train_net_step.py ... --load_ckpt {path/to/the/checkpoint}
```
or using Detectron's checkpoint file
```
python tools/train_net_step.py ... --load_detectron {path/to/the/checkpoint}
```

### Resume training with the same dataset and batch size
```
python tools/train_net_step.py ... --load_ckpt {path/to/the/checkpoint} --resume
```
When resume the training, **step count** and **optimizer state** will also be restored from the checkpoint. For SGD optimizer, optimizer state contains the momentum for each trainable parameter.

**NOTE**: `--resume` is not yet supported for `--load_detectron`

### Set config options in command line
```
  python tools/train_net_step.py ... --no_save --set {config.name1} {value1} {config.name2} {value2} ...
```
- For Example, run for debugging.
  ```
  python tools/train_net_step.py ... --no_save --set DEBUG True
  ```
  Load less annotations to accelarate training progress. Add `--no_save` to avoid saving any checkpoint or logging.

### Show command line help messages
```
python train_net_step.py --help
```

### Two Training Scripts

In short, use `train_net_step.py`.

In `train_net_step.py`:
- `SOLVER.LR_POLICY: steps_with_decay` is supported.
- Training warm up in [Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677) is supported.

(Deprecated) In `train_net.py` some config options have no effects and worth noticing:

 - `SOLVER.LR_POLICY`, `SOLVER.MAX_ITER`, `SOLVER.STEPS`,`SOLVER.LRS`:
  For now, the training policy is controlled by these command line arguments:

    - **`--epochs`**: How many epochs to train. One epoch means one travel through the whole training sets. Defaults to  6.
    - **`--lr_decay_epochs `**: Epochs to decay the learning rate on. Decay happens on the beginning of a epoch. Epoch is 0-indexed. Defaults to [4, 5].

   For more command line arguments, please refer to `python train_net.py --help`

- `SOLVER.WARM_UP_ITERS`, `SOLVER.WARM_UP_FACTOR`, `SOLVER.WARM_UP_METHOD`:
  Training warm up is not supported.

## Inference

### Evaluate the training results
For example, test mask-rcnn on coco2017 val set
```
python tools/test_net.py --dataset coco2017 --cfg config/baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-50-FPN_1x.yaml --load_ckpt {path/to/your/checkpoint}
```
Use `--load_detectron` to load Detectron's checkpoint. If multiple gpus are available, add `--multi-gpu-testing`.

Specify a different output directry, use `--output_dir {...}`. Defaults to `{the/parent/dir/of/checkpoint}/test`

### Visualize the training results on images
```
python tools/infer_simple.py --dataset coco --cfg cfgs/baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-50-C4.yml --load_ckpt {path/to/your/checkpoint} --image_dir {dir/of/input/images}  --output_dir {dir/to/save/visualizations}
```
`--output_dir` defaults to `infer_outputs`.

## Supported Network modules

- Keypoints head:
  `roi_pose_head_v1convX`

**NOTE**: the naming is similar to the one used in Detectron. Just remove any prepending `add_`.

## Supported Datasets

Only COCO is supported for now. However, the whole dataset library implementation is almost identical to Detectron's, so it should be easy to add more datasets supported by Detectron.

## Configuration Options

Architecture specific configuration files are put under [configs](configs/). The general configuration file [lib/core/config.py](lib/core/config.py) **has almost all the options with same default values as in Detectron's**, so it's effortless to transform the architecture specific configs from Detectron.

**Some options from Detectron are not used** because the corresponding functionalities are not implemented yet. For example, data augmentation on testing.

### Extra options
- `MODEL.LOAD_IMAGENET_PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS = True`:  Whether to load ImageNet pretrained weights.
  - `RESNETS.IMAGENET_PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS = ''`: Path to pretrained residual network weights. If start with `'/'`, then it is treated as a absolute path. Otherwise, treat as a relative path to `ROOT_DIR`.
- `TRAIN.ASPECT_CROPPING = False`, `TRAIN.ASPECT_HI = 2`, `TRAIN.ASPECT_LO = 0.5`: Options for aspect cropping to restrict image aspect ratio range.
- `RPN.OUT_DIM_AS_IN_DIM = True`, `RPN.OUT_DIM = 512`, `RPN.CLS_ACTIVATION = 'sigmoid'`: Official implement of RPN has same input and output feature channels and use sigmoid as the activation function for fg/bg class prediction. In [jwyang's implementation](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/blob/master/lib/model/rpn/rpn.py#L28), it fix output channel number to 512 and use softmax as activation function.

### How to transform configuration files from Detectron

1. Remove `MODEL.NUM_CLASSES`. It will be set according to the dataset specified by `--dataset`.
2. Remove `TRAIN.WEIGHTS`, `TRAIN.DATASETS` and `TEST.DATASETS`
3. For module type options (e.g `MODEL.CONV_BODY`, `FAST_RCNN.ROI_BOX_HEAD` ...), remove `add_` in the string if exists.
4. If want to load ImageNet pretrained weights for the model, add `RESNETS.IMAGENET_PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS` pointing to the pretrained weight file. If not, set `MODEL.LOAD_IMAGENET_PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS` to `False`.
5. [Optional] Delete `OUTPUT_DIR: .` at the last line
6. Do **NOT** change the option `NUM_GPUS` in the config file. It's used to infer the original batch size for training, and learning rate will be linearly scaled according to batch size change. Proper learning rate adjustment is important for training with different batch size.
7. For group normalization baselines, add `RESNETS.USE_GN: True`.

## My nn.DataParallel

- **Keep certain keyword inputs on cpu**
  Official DataParallel will broadcast all the input Variables to GPUs. However, many rpn related computations are done in CPU, and it's unnecessary to put those related inputs on GPUs.
- **Allow Different blob size for different GPU**
  To save gpu memory, images are padded seperately for each gpu.
- **Work with returned value of dictionary type**
